# Getting started

## What WritingTool does

WritingTool is a small, system-wide Windows app that helps you improve text quickly:

- Proofread and fix grammar/spelling
- Rewrite text (friendlier, more professional, more concise)
- Summarize, extract key points, convert to tables
- Translate between languages

## Basic workflow

1. Copy (or select) the text you want to improve.
2. Press the hotkey (default: `Ctrl+Space`).
3. Click one of the action buttons (Proofread, Rewrite, Summary, …).
4. Use the output (copy / replace) depending on the action and window mode.

## Hotkey

The default hotkey is `Ctrl+Space`. You can change it in Settings.

## First run setup

1. Open the tray icon menu and choose **Settings**.
2. Pick your provider (Gemini / OpenAI-compatible / Ollama).
3. Add the required settings (API key, model name, base URL, …).

Next: see `providers.md` for provider-specific setup.
